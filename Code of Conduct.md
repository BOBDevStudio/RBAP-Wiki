## General rules

* Have common sense when posting anything.
* You can post constructive criticism but at least double check that it is actually constructive criticism before you post it.
* Any rules set in the [Contributing](https://github.com/BOBDevStudio/RBAP-Wiki/blob/Wiki/.github/Contributing.md) file also apply here. If a rule is mentioned in both files take the version in **this** file as the most accurate unless stated otherwise.
* All rules listed here and in the [Contributing](https://github.com/BOBDevStudio/RBAP-Wiki/blob/Wiki/.github/Contributing.md) file also apply to the [BOBDevStudio/RBAP-Wiki-Comments](https://github.com/BOBDevStudio/RBAP-Wiki-Comments) repository.

## Pull requests usage rules

You are not allowed to post pull requests unless you fall under at least one of the two following categories:

* BOB has personally said to you that you are allowed to help ***maintain*** wiki and has given you permissions to do so.
* You are a staff member of the BOB Development Studio's Github operations which has also been authorized to help ***maintain*** the wiki and has been given access to the repository. **Only** given access to the repository to help ***moderate*** it does not count for this.

This might change in the future but for now this is how it is. Read the [Contributing](https://github.com/BOBDevStudio/RBAP-Wiki/blob/Wiki/.github/Contributing.md) file for more info on this.

## Don't abuse automated systems

If you decide to abuse automated systems that will be pretty easily result in you being blocked from interacting on any repository by the BOB Development Studio.

## Ending note

Staff members of the BOB Development Studio's Github operations (which have also been authorized to help maintain this repository/wiki) reserve the full right to punish you for any reason they see fit and in whatever way they see fit. BOB reserves the right to overrule their decision but it's incredibly unlikely he ever will (and asking for it will not help).
