Due to it being from the old system it is unlikely that it will ever be given a version number due to the fact that the old system predates the current version numbers system. It is also unlikely that it will ever have a listed exact publish time. More info on this is available in the [notes about the update log system](/wiki/posts/update-log-notes)."
