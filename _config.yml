Update logs for updates older than <code>RBAP Update / V3.0.0</code> are too unreliable to include in this list even If they're applicable. And lastly the primary source of information for this list is update logs meaning if the text in an update log is vague the text on here will likely be as well."

It is also unlikely that it will ever have a listed exact publish time. More info on this is available in the [notes about the update log system](/wiki/posts/update-log-notes)."
