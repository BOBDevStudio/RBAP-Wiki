* Updates before March 9th, 2019 are not logged anywhere due to the update log post on the Roblox dev forum not existing before then.
* Any update log for a version before V3 is considered not being actively maintained. When an update log is considered this they are purposely hard to find.
* * Reasons for this are as follows:
* * * BOB is less familiar with those updates since it's been a while since he's made them.
* * * Many of the old update logs have unnecessary hype like for example some of them may say "`ALL-NEW`". BOB has stopped using this style of update log for quite some time now.
* * * * Also there is more differences between the styles of update logs in between the old update logs and the new update logs. Overall the newer ones are more high quality than the older ones.
* * * Many of the changes listed in them are either changed or removed.
* Probably in the near future the update logs post on the Roblox dev forum will probably stop being used in favor of update logs hosted in the game and in this website.
* * This will definitely not happening until there is some way for BOB to list the exact time of the update on the website
