* After a few hours of hard work (that started in 2018 and ended in 2019) a "Servers/Worlds" list has been released!
* The mute button has been removed (for now) because it was in the way of the "Servers/Worlds" button/list
* After a few hours of hard and frustrating work the update log now has animations when you click/tap the next or previous button.
