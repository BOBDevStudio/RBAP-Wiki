    text: "`V1.0.0` is not the same as saying `Random Buildings And Parts is now publicly available`. Although it **is** the first update to use a version numbering system it **does not** indicate the game is now publicly available. Nobody knows the exact date that Random Buildings And Parts was released as that been lost to time (for the time being at least)."
