  start_text: "A note before I start: At the time of writing I have been suffering from creator burnout from RBAP (the game itself) since soon after the release of <code>RBAP Update / V6.0.0</code>. So for this update I just wanted to do something simple to see if I can regain my motivation for working on the game. I already had the new UI design language figured out a few months ago so it just needed to be implemented."
