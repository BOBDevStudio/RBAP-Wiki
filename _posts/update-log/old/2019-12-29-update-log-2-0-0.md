**Note:** Do to how old the update described in this update log is this update log is not being actively maintained. This shouldn't affect the usability of the page but stuff like spelling mistakes and overall unnecessary hype that used to be used in update logs are unlikely to be fixed.

### This update included...

* An entirely new map design! <s class="spoiler">(I don't even know how to say all the changes that I've made to it.)</s>
* An entirely new UI that combines all the previous UI into one! (**I'm still working on it.**)
* 5 new docks
* A betterly organized backend
* My version of the Roblox Bloxys statue now has wings like the normal one.

### This update sadly removed...

* All previously existing UI
* The previous map
* All the badges (somewhat temporarily)
