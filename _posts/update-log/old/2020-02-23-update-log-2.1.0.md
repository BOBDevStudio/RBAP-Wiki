### This update included...

* An ALL-NEW way for **VIP server owners can now control docks!**
* Winter has left [Random Buildings And Parts](https://www.roblox.com/games/6033036061/).

* The name tags have been revamped:
* * The titles are now finally up-to-date with the current ranks of the [group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/3541233/). That means you will gain appropriate titles for which rank you're in instead of gaining ones for other ranks.

* * Everything in it now uses a new font.
