* Most updates before March 9th, 2019 are not logged anywhere due to the update log post on the Roblox dev forum not existing before then.
* * Some of the update logs have been recovered from older versions of Random Buildings And Parts due to there being an old update log system but that system was set up and ran differently to how the current update log system is ran. Bottom line is don't be expecting it to be full-proof.
* * * To add on to that there were periods of time where the game had no update log system in place. For example there was a time (which was roughly 2 months long) in between when the old system got removed and the update log post was made where no updates were logged.
* Update logs describing updates that are older than March 9th, 2019 do not have version numbers and have no guarantees they will have the exact time the update was published.
* * This is due to the fact that they predate the update log post and were actually made for a system from around late 2018. Plus they had to be extracted from older versions of Random Buildings And Parts.
* Any update log for a version before V3 is considered not being actively maintained. When an update log is considered this they are purposely hard to find.
* * Reasons for this are as follows:
* * * BOB is less familiar with those updates since it's been a while since he's made them.
* * * Many of the old update logs have unnecessary hype like for example some of them may say "`ALL-NEW`". BOB has stopped using this style of update log for quite some time now.
* * * * Also there are more differences between the styles of update logs in between the old update logs and the new update logs. Overall the newer ones are more high quality than the older ones.
* * * Many of the changes listed in them are either changed or removed.
* All updates after and including [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0) use a new way of determining version numbers which is as follows (starting from the left):
* * The first number indicates a future focused update that is so impactful that It is hard to not notice a change from it (at the time of it being released). These usually contain many future focused changes.
* * The second number Indicates update that is at least partly future focused. These usually contain future focused changes but not many of them.
* * The third number indicates a pretty small update. These usually only contain bug fixes and/or minor improvements. They also have a chance of being made on the spot (like a quick maintenance update that wasn't planned ahead of time).
