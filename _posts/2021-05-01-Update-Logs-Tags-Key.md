| Tag Name | Tag Info |
|-|-|
| Most Recent (Feature Focused Update)	| The *feature focused* update that is the most recently added (to the [Main Build](/Wiki/RBAP#main-build)) (and must also not contain only minor changes). The update that is tagged as this is likely an update that you can at least find a few ways that it is visibly different then update that came before it. This tag is not used on an update when the update already qualifies for the `Most Recent` tag. |
| Most Recent							| The update that is the most recently added (to the [Main Build](/Wiki/RBAP#main-build)). |
| Biggest Yet							| The update is what BOB considers to be the biggest and/or most impactful one yet. It might not actually be the biggest and/or most impactful one yet as it is just based off what BOB thinks. |
| Improvements Only						| The update mainly/only improves upon stuff already in the game. |
| Bug Fixes Only						| The update mainly/only includes bug fixes. |
| Only In Pre-Update Build]				| The update is not yet released to the [Main Build](/Wiki/RBAP#main-build) but is released to the [Pre-Update Build](/Wiki/RBAP#pre-update-build). |
| Changelog Not Finalized				| The changelog for the update is still being actively worked on thus making it so it should **not** be taken as 100% accurate and correct. |
| RBAP Beta								| The changelog was made back when the Random Buildings And Parts was still considered to be in beta. |
