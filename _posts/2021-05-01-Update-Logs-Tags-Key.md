| Tag Name                             | Tag Info |
|-|-|
| Most Recent (Feature Focused Update) | The *feature focused* update that is the most recently added (to the main game) (and must also not contain only minor changes). The update that is tagged as this is likely an update that you can at least find a few ways that it is visibly different then update that came before it. This tag is not used on an update when the update already qualifies for the `Most Recent` tag. |
| Most Recent                          | The update that is the most recently added (to the main game). |
| Biggest Yet                          | The update is what BOB considers to be the biggest and/or most impactful one yet. It might not actually be the biggest and/or most impactful one yet as it is just based off what BOB thinks. |
| Improvements Only                    | The update only mainly improves upon stuff already in the game. |
| Bug Fixes Only                       | The update only mainly includes bug fixes. |
| Only In Pre-Update Build             | The update is not yet released to the main build of the game but is released to the pre-update build of the game. |
| Changelog Not Finalized              | The changelog for the update is still being actively worked on thus making it so it should **not** be taken as 100% accurate and correct. |
| RBAP Beta                            | The changelog was made back when the Random Buildings And Parts was still considered to be in beta. |
