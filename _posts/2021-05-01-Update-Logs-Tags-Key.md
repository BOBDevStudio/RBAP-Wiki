| Tag Name                 | Tag Info |
|-|-|
| Most Recent              | The update that is the most recently added (to the main game). |
| Biggest Yet              | The update is what {% include BOB %} considers to be the biggest (and/or probably most impactful) one yet; which that means it might not actually be the biggest (or most impactful) one yet. |
| Improvements Only        | The update only mainly improves upon stuff already in the game. |
| Bug Fixes Only           | The update only mainly includes bug fixes. |
| Only In Pre-Update Build | The changelog for the update is talking about a new update that is yet to be released to the main game but is released to the pre-update build of Random Buildings And Parts. |
| Changelog Not Finalized  | The changelog for the update is still being actively worked on thus making it so it should not be taken as 100% accurate and correct. |
| RBAP Beta                | The changelog was made back when the Random Buildings And Parts was still considered to be in beta. |
