| Tag Name | Tag Info |
|-|-|
| Most Recent (Feature Focused Update)	| The *feature focused* update that is the most recently added (to the [Main Build]({{- "/wiki/rbap#main-build" | relative_url -}})) (and must also not contain only minor changes). The update that is tagged as this is likely an update that you can at least find a few ways that it is visibly different then update that came before it. This tag is not used on an update when the update already qualifies for the `Most Recent` tag. |
| Most Recent							| The update that is the most recently added (to the [Main Build]({{- "/wiki/rbap#main-build" | relative_url -}})). |
| Biggest Yet							| The update is what BOB considers to be the biggest and/or most impactful one yet. It might not actually be the biggest and/or most impactful one yet as it is just based off what BOB thinks. |
| Improvements Only						| The update mainly/only improves upon stuff already in the game. |
| Bug Fixes Only						| The update mainly/only includes bug fixes. |
| RBAP Beta								| The changelog was made back when the Random Buildings And Parts was still considered to be in beta. |
