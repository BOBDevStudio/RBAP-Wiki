# Summary of its changes
{: .update-log-section-title}



# List of its changes
{: .update-log-section-title}

* Updated the game rooms dock:
* * Update the Game Says game:
* * * It now has 5 rounds instead of 10.
* * * There's an easter egg that has been added that can only be found on the 24th of any month or when Unbitterness is in the server when the Game Says game starts. (The 24th was chosen by Unbitterness btw.)
* * Update the Four Corners game:
* * * None yet.
* * Update the Four Corners: Reversed game:
* * * None yet.
* Another thing has been added that will only appear on the 24th of any month as well: The old game rooms dock! (Day also chosen by Unbitterness btw.)
* * Due to limitations of the dock placing system among other reasons the server has to be started after it becomes the 24th. If the server is started after it then the dock will be placed.
* * 15 minutes before midnight the dock entrance's dock type will change and then 15 minutes later the gate will be raised. It has a margin of error of at most a minute.
* There's now a more unified way to have a time zone used by most of the game. Look for the new statistic on the server and game info dock for the time zone being used.
* * The two previously listed things that happen on the 24th use the time zone listed. No other parts of the game use it as of this update.
* Added other changes to the server and game info dock as well:
* * Fixed the server running time statistic. It wasn't necessarily broken, it was just off by around 30 seconds usually. Now it's off by around 1 second to a really long small decimal.
* * The private server owner user id Statistic has been shortened to private server owner and now displays the username instead.
* Added three new dock types all of which are used for the old game rooms dock. You can find them documented on the wiki [here](), [here](), and [here]().
* Added a few minor changes to 2 systems which manage the reset button and falling off of the map respectively:
* * Both systems now take into account whether a spawn location is actually enabled or not. Also they now make sure that it's an actual spawn location too.
* * The system that manages players' characters that have fallen off the map now checks player character locations every second instead of every quarter of a second.
