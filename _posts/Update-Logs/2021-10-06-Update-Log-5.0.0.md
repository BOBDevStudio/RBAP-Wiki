# Summary of its changes
{: .update-log-section-title}

* Added two new docks! The [Wheel of Oddities](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Wheel-of-Oddities-Dock) and the [Moving Spotlight](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Moving-Spotlight-Dock) both of which are interactive.
* The dock placing system has now been completely remade! It is also now officially called the Dock System.
* * It includes the ability to live add and remove docks! The previous system only added docks when the game was doing initial loading.
* * All docks (as of this update) can know when players are on them. This is primarily used by the Dock System and not individual docks with the exception of the two new ones.
* * Dock entrances 1, 2, and 3 on the map's main sides 1 and 2 are now only for docks with reserved dock entrances. Meaning docks will not be automatically placed at those dock entrances.
* New docks will now temporarily be placed near the entrance elevator with the signs of the dock entrances used by the dock having a new dock indicator on them.
* Updated the [Game Rooms Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock):
* * Recoded the entire system.
* * Updated the [Four Corners](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock#four-corners), the [Four Corners: Reversed](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock#four-corners-reversed), and the [Game Says](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock#game-says) game.
* * Added the [Light Chaser](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock#light-chaser) game.
* Another thing has been added that will only appear on the 24th of any month as well: The old [Game Rooms Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock)! (Day also (*unknowingly*) chosen by Unbitterness btw.)
* Merged the [Update Logs Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Update-Logs-Dock) and the [Server And Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Server-And-Game-Info-Dock) into a new dock called the [Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Info-Dock).
* * Although the merging of those two docks is the major change there is also a new sign which displays the game's credits.
* Remodeled the model used for dock entrances. It has a lot more detail than the previous one and is overall more lighter.
* The plant beds model has been removed and replaced with a single plant bed in the center of the map where the Player Conveyors used to be.
* * It includes stuff like taller trees and use of Roblox's grass.
* Recoded the entire music system.
* * Since I was working on the music system I decided to add some new songs. Refer to [the new wiki page on it](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Music) for more info.
* * Added back special music to the intro **and** added back special music to the [Rainbow Dance Floor Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Rainbow-Dance-Floor-Dock).
* * Also added some new on screen UI that indicates what song has started playing. Unlike the one in the [Stage](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Stage-Dock) this one is temporary and only lasts for a few seconds.
* Added new functionality to falling off of the map:
* * Now when you fall off the map there are points all around the map where you could be teleported to. If one of those points is closer than a randomly selected spawn location then you will ultimately land around that point.
* Changed the most key lighting settings
* * The game will appear brighter and shadows will not make the area affected by them pitch black.
* Changed the skybox to a custom one and added Roblox's atmosphere effect and Roblox's clouds to supplement it.
* Added what I like to call a snow day to the game which is to say during December 18th to 26th most of the map gets covered in snow.
* Added some Halloween decorations during the month of October.
* There's now a more unified way to have a time zone used by most of the game. Look for the new statistic on the Server And Game Info sign on the [Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Info-Dock) for the time zone being used.
* The [NPCs Key Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/NPCs-Key-Dock) is now considered a system dock once again.
* The time of day is now set to the time of the game's time zone.
* Added two more dock entrances to both main sides of the map.
* Flipped around Spring and Summer color palettes.

# List of its changes
{: .update-log-section-title}

* Added two new docks! The [Wheel of Oddities](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Wheel-of-Oddities-Dock) and the [Moving Spotlight](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Moving-Spotlight-Dock) both of which are interactive.
* This took a while and a LOT of work to make but it was definitely worth it: The dock placing system has now been completely remade! It is also now officially called the Dock System.
* * It includes the ability to live add and remove docks! The previous system only added docks when the game was doing initial loading.
* * It is also **much** more flexible and robust than the old system.
* * Somewhat related change: Clients now retrieve docks when they're being loaded in a more reliable way. The old way left room for errors when players try to join the game after docks have been loaded.
* * All docks (as of this update) can know when players are on them. This is primarily used by the Dock System and not individual docks with the exception of the two new ones.
* * Dock entrances 1, 2, and 3 on the map's main sides 1 and 2 are now only for docks with reserved dock entrances. Meaning docks will not be automatically placed at those dock entrances.
* New docks will now temporarily be placed near the entrance elevator with the signs of the dock entrances used by the dock having a new dock indicator on them. (*Only works with certain supported dock entrance types.)
* * The length of how long they're placed there is not a hard set number and is set manually for each dock.
* Updated the [Game Rooms Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock):
* * Played around with the coloring of all the platforms in the game rooms.
* * * Also changed the platform colors that are used in each game.
* * Recoded the entire system. Unlike other system recodes (for example the new Dock System) this one was not made to add big features it is simply just to give the system a facelift backend-wise.
* * * There shouldn't be many user-facing differences compared to the old system. In fact a lot of this system is based off the old system.
* * Updated the [Game Says](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock#game-says) game:
* * * It now has 7 rounds instead of 10.
* * * There's an easter egg that has been added that can only be found on the 24th of any month or when Unbitterness is in the server when the Game Says game starts. (The 24th was (*unknowingly*) chosen by Unbitterness btw.)
* * Updated the [Four Corners](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock#four-corners) and the [Four Corners: Reversed](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock#four-corners-reversed) game:
* * * When one of the colored platforms is being lowered the text on top of them is no longer abruptly removed.
* * Added the [Light Chaser](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock#light-chaser) game.
* * Made it so you're no longer able to walk under the Game Rooms' barriers.
* Another thing has been added that will only appear on the 24th of any month as well: The old [Game Rooms Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock)! (Day also (*unknowingly*) chosen by Unbitterness btw.)
* * Once it turns the 24th of any month the dock will be placed in all existing and new servers. At 11:45 PM the dock entrance's dock entrance type will be changed. Then at midnight the gate of the dock entrance will be raised. Finally at 15 minutes after the gate is raised the dock will be removed.
* * * Each of these timed events has a margin of error of at most a minute (not counting the accuracy of lua API).
* Merged the [Update Logs Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Update-Logs-Dock) and the [Server And Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Server-And-Game-Info-Dock) into a new dock called the [Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Info-Dock).
* * Although the merging of those two docks is the major change there is also a new sign which displays the game's credits.
* * [Insert lore about the sign design being redesigned due to "advances in new technologies" here lol]
* * * (Hopefully the readability is still fine as I tried my best to keep it futuristic but also readable.)
* * For now the [Donations Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Donation-Dock) will not be affected from this change do to it (at the time of writing) still being broken among other reasons.
* Remodeled the model used for dock entrances. It has a lot more detail than the previous one and is overall more lighter.
* The plant beds model has been removed and replaced with a single plant bed in the center of the map where the Player Conveyors used to be.
* * It includes stuff like taller trees and use of Roblox's grass.
* * As a result of this change other changes have happened:
* * * Added 1 (but technically 2) new street light designs.
* * * Moved the Player Conveyors.
* * * Made the middle of the map 30 studs wider.
* * * Moved the map slightly up in order to be on par with Roblox terrain's 4x4x4 size.
* Recoded the entire music system.
* * Much like the game rooms dock recode this recode was done to clean up the backend of the system as it was getting **very** dated.
* * * Fun fact: To give you an idea of how bad it was that was the *original* custom music system from *at least* a year ago that I made while having no idea what I was doing + barely any idea on how to make it.
* * Since I was working on the music system I decided to add some new songs. Refer to [the new wiki page on it](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Music) for more info.
* * * Also fixed a few songs that accidentally used the promo version of them.
* * Added back special music to the intro **and** added back special music to the [Rainbow Dance Floor Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Rainbow-Dance-Floor-Dock) (not using the original music sadly).
* * Added the ability to have music available to be played only in certain time frames.
* * Also added some new on screen UI that indicates what song has started playing. Unlike the one in the [Stage](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Stage-Dock) this one is temporary and only lasts for a few seconds.
* * The only feature that this new music system drops is the music muting when the Roblox client is not focused.
* Added new functionality to falling off of the map:
* * Now when you fall off the map there are points all around the map where you could be teleported to. If one of those points is closer than a randomly selected spawn location then you will ultimately land around that point. If the spawn location is closer than the nearest point the old functionality will be used.
* * * If you get teleported to one of the points you will be falling for a longer due to me wanting to change the animation and the new animation not being compatible with the spawn locations.
* * * If the randomly selected spawn location is (somehow) the same distance away from your character as the nearest point the spawn location has priority.
* * * In case you're wondering, all but one of the points are in front of dock entrances as of this update. (Each dock entrance has one in front of it.)
* Changed the most key lighting settings
* * The game will appear brighter and shadows will not make the area affected by them pitch black.
* * * Sadly this isn't a good change in some places like the window showcases but because overall it's a good change I'm keeping it.
* Changed the skybox to a custom one and added Roblox's atmosphere effect and Roblox's clouds to supplement it.
* * RIP the old skybox 2019-2021
* Added what I like to call a snow day to the game which is to say during December 18th to 26th most of the map gets covered in snow.
* Added some Halloween decorations during the month of October.
* There's now a more unified way to have a time zone used by most of the game. Look for the new statistic on the Server And Game Info sign on the [Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Info-Dock) for the time zone being used.
* * The two previously listed things that happen on the 24th use the time zone listed.
* Added other changes to the Server And Game Info sign on the [Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Info-Dock) as well:
* * Fixed the server running time statistic. It wasn't necessarily broken, it was just off by around 30 seconds usually. Now it's off by around 1 second to a really long small decimal.
* * The private server owner user id statistic has been shortened to private server owner and now displays the username instead.
* The [NPCs Key Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/NPCs-Key-Dock) is now considered a system dock once again.
* The time of day is now set to the time of the game's time zone.
* Added some improvements to the dock entrance system:
* * Most notable is because of the remodel dock entrance types now the ability to control some new lights that I like to call warning lights. As of this update only the 3 new dock entrance types use it.
* * Improved some major parts of the system like for example there are now default values for dock entrance type data values. Although that's really the only notable difference.
* Rotated the entire map. Only did this because it drove me nuts.
* * You shouldn't be able to notice this change as all the immediately obvious bugs caused by this change have been fixed but there is a chance there could be others. That is why it's being mentioned here in the first place.
* * The sun and moon will set and rise 90 degrees off to the side due to the map rotation.
* Added six new dock entrance types:
* * [Temporarily Open](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Temporarily-Open)
* * [Temporarily Open - Closing Soon](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Temporarily-Open-Closing-Soon)
* * [Temporarily Open - Closed Live](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Temporarily-Open-Closed-Live)
* * [Open - New Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Open-New-Dock)
* * [Under Maintenance - New Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Under-Maintenance-New-Dock)
* * [Closed - New Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Closed-New-Dock)
* * [Donations Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Donations-Dock)
* * [Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Game-Info-Dock)
* * [NPCs Key Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/NPCs-Key-Dock)
* Added two more dock entrances to both main sides of the map.
* Flipped around Spring and Summer color palettes.
* Added some very light text to the wall behind the Music Waves effect in the stage that denotes the name of it. Didn't want to make it too intrusive, that's why it's very light but still readable.
* Changed the color, material, and height of the area beneath the entrance elevator to match the area beneath most of the center of the map.
* Reduced Z-fighting on the rainbow dance floor when looking at it from a distance.
* Fixed a bug where the text and the background color of the UI on the signs on the [Old Game Rooms Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Old-Game-Rooms-Dock) would Z-fight.
* * I don't normally fix bugs related to removed docks and the like. This one just happened to be on my mind while I was going to bed. Also I haven't had time to test out this bug fix so no idea if it actually fixes the bug.
* Disabled 3 spawn locations. 1 on the top floor and 2 on the bottom floor.
* Removed the barriers around the map due to the Wheel of Oddities dock
* Added a few minor changes to 2 systems which manage the reset button and falling off of the map respectively:
* * Both systems now take into account whether a spawn location is actually enabled or not. Also they now make sure that it's an actual spawn location too.
* * The system that manages players' characters that have fallen off the map now checks player character locations every second instead of every quarter second.
