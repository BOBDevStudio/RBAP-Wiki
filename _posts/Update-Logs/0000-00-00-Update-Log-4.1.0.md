# Summary of its changes

# List of its changes
{: .update-log-section-title}

* A new settings panel has been added!
* * You can now finally edit the titles that you have equipped! I've been wanting to make this a reality for quite some time now as I originally came up with the idea in at least late 2018.
* * * The titles listed in the title settings' dropdown are sorted by priority which is used by the title system to determine what title you should have equipped when the auto option is on.
* * * There are 2 options that are not titles. They are the none and the auto option. The none option should be pretty self-explanatory but the auto auction may not be so let's explain it a little bit:
* * * * This is the default option. When selected it gives the title system permission to pick which title it thinks you should have based on the priority of each title you have available. If you have none then it will show none but if you have at least one it will show which one has the highest priority. Due to a technical limitation when you select the auto option the title on your character will be removed but this only lasts until you respawn your character.
* * * When all three title settings are set to auto the system does not save any title preference data related to you and if you already had a save existing it will be removed.
* * If you think the panel is not up-to-date with the rest of the game simply reopen it as that forces it to reload it's data. If it still does not update then there is a bug that needs to be fixed.
* Some new rewards for purchasing donations have been added: They are titles! Each donation amount has its own title with the color getting brighter and the wording getting better as you purchase higher and higher donation amounts.
* Donation amount #5 has been decreased to 250 Robux and donation amount #6 has been put back on sale (for the original price of donation amount #5).
* Both lists of changes on the update logs dock have been changed
* * The overall amount of space dedicated to a change is now automatically determined instead of manually.
* * The text is no longer scaled by Roblox meaning everything is the same size. Overall text size is lower then it used to be though.
* * There is now a wider gap in between each change.
* Edited how the live updating titles system of the new name tags system that was introduced in the previous update ([`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/4-0-0)) works.
* * It also now supports the option to clear data (which is used in the auto option of the settings panel as explained earlier).
