**Note:** Do to how old the update described in this update log is this update log is not being actively maintained. This shouldn't affect the usability of the page but stuff like spelling mistakes and overall unnecessary hype that used to be used in update logs are unlikely to be fixed.

**Note:** This update log was originally made for the long gone in-game update log system from around late 2018. Due to it being from that old system don't expect to see the exact publish time or what version number it is as none of those existed in that old system. More info on this is available in the [notes about the update log system](https://bobdevstudio.github.io/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log-Notes).

* The ground parts of the Christmas edition/world/server of Random Buildings And Parts have been changed to look like snow instead of just white blank plates.
* You can now see the chat when the game asks if BOB is in the game with you.
