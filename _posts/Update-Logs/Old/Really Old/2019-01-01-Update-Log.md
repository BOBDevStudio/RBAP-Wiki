**Note:** Do to how old the update described in this update log is this update log is not being actively maintained. This shouldn't affect the usability of the page but stuff like spelling mistakes and overall unnecessary hype that used to be used in update logs are unlikely to be fixed.

**Note:** This update log was originally made for the long gone in-game update log system from around late 2018. Due to it being from that old system don't expect to see the exact publish time or what version number it is as none of those existed in that old system. More info on this is available in the [notes about the update log system](https://bobdevstudio.github.io/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log-Notes).
{: .notice--warning}

* After a few hours of hard work (that started in 2018 and ended in 2019) a "Servers/Worlds" list has been released!
* The mute button has been removed (for now) because it was in the way of the "Servers/Worlds" button/list
* After a few hours of hard and frustrating work the update log now has animations when you click/tap the next or previous button.
