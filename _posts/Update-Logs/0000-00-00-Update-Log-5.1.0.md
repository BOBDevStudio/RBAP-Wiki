* Improved the Update Logs sign on the [Game Info Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Game-Info-Dock):
* * There are more update logs listed now.
* * * Press the new buttons located at the top of the sign in order to flip through each one.
* * * For the time being it does not live update.
* * Having trouble reading the update logs because your character is obstructing your view? Now when you press `Ctrl` + `U` while looking at the update logs your character will go invisible. Once you are ready to get rid of the effect simply look away from the update logs.
* * * In case you're curious why I chose `U` as the key, the `U` in `Ctrl` + `U` stands for **U**pdate Logs.
* There's a new door on the top level of the entrance elevator. It's meant to be a replacement for the group logo on the elevator itself that was removed a while ago.
* All non Christmas Day music now is 3 times as likely to be played.
* The Christmas Day music is now 5 times as likely to be played instead of the original 3 times as likely. (Reason for it being so common is that it Is only available for 2 days.)
* The booster on the bottom of the entrance elevator is now round.
* * Fun fact: This actually takes advantage of a very new technology that was released onto Roblox only a week ago at the time of writing. This would have probably been the original design of the booster had the technology existed when the booster design was made.
