# Summary of its changes
{: .update-log-section-title}

{StartUpdateSummariesList}
{: .internal-use-only}

* Made some changes to the [shop]({{- "/wiki/shop" | relative_url -}}).
* * When your character gets live updated (as in it keeps its original position) the music system will no longer recognize that as a zone change.
* * The buttons that let you equip and unequip an item no longer have their text clipped sometimes.
* The trunks of trees in plant bed in the center of the map are no longer cylindrical.
* The `/bubblechat` command in the (text) chat now actually accepts the word `yes` instead of the misspelling of `yee`.

* Made some changes to the [shop]({{- "/wiki/shop" | relative_url -}}).
* * When your character gets live updated (as in it keeps its original position) the music system will no longer recognize that as a zone change.
* * * Fun fact for anyone who might find it funny: Although it wasn't expected the custom map music in Game Room 3 works with this too. I was surprised when it did work with it but due to how the two music systems are implemented the systems just happened to crossover each other. It's quite technical but intriguing how it worked out like that.
* * The buttons that let you equip and unequip an item no longer have their text clipped sometimes.
* * * Unfortunately there is a slightly related issue where the scroll bar in the item info panel let's you go a bit farther than the size of the actual content. This is a problem on Roblox's end and to add insult to injury I don't even have permission to report it to them. Thanks Roblox. :/
* The trunks of trees in plant bed in the center of the map are no longer cylindrical.
* The `/bubblechat` command in the (text) chat now actually accepts the word `yes` instead of the misspelling of `yee`. Just happened to be looking at the code for that command and spotted the misspelling.
* * In case you're wondering, `yee` will now return the error message that `yes` was returning.
* Fixed a technical overhead issue with using quotes and escaping quotes in a command perimeter in the (text) chat. It had the chance to remove escaped quotes from the final (sent) message but it's a bit too technical to explain in-depth here.
