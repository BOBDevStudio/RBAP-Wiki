* Improved the Halloween decorations.
* * Remove most decorations and added new ones and animated all of them so they no longer just appear out of nowhere.
* * The Player Conveyors now change colors while decorations for Halloween are placed.
* Improved the game's custom (text) chat.
* * Integrated the chat with [Roblox's Avatar Context Menu](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Avatar-Context-Menu).
* * * There are three custom buttons on it that help you to do stuff like muting/unmuting a player and private messaging a player.
* * * Now when you click on a message sent from a player (*that is not yourself*) the menu will appear.
* * Now when you click on certain messages (mostly system ones) the text in the chat bar gets changed.
* * * In this update this is mostly used for setting the text back to what it was before it was sent.
* * * The messages that this applies to are:
* * * * Ones where it's showing you a command you tried to use (successfully or unsuccessfully). Although whether it works in a certain scenario is decided by the command that was used.
* * * * Certain message regulation error messages. If one does support it will be mentioned in the error message itself.
* * * * System messages sent due to a friend joining and joining a friend.
* * The mute commands now support only searching player usernames instead of searching through display names and user IDs as well.
* * * In order to use it simply add the @ character before you type the username. The username typed is not case sensitive but it must be spelled the exact same as a player's username. 
* * * * This was really only intended for use in the custom buttons added to [Roblox's Avatar Context Menu](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Avatar-Context-Menu).
* * The chat now checks users' chat privacy settings in a more context-aware way.
* * * Or in other words instead of just checking the sending and receiving player alone it will now check the sending and the receiving player together. (Applies to everything, not just private messaging.)
* * Uppercase characters are now regulated.
* * * Meaning you cannot have some amount of uppercase characters in a message at a time.
* * Message regulation and sending now plays more nicely with Unicode characters.
* Added back [Roblox's Avatar Context Menu](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Avatar-Context-Menu) for some of the aforementioned chat improvements. (It used to be in the game a few years ago FYI.)
* * There's a few default buttons that have been removed due to uselessness and/or chat compatibility reasons.
