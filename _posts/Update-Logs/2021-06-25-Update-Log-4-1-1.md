* Fixed the [Update Logs Dock](/Wiki/Docks/Update-Logs-Dock).
* Fixed the [Server And Game Info Dock](/Wiki/Docks/Server-And-Game-Info-Dock).
* Couldn't fix the [Donations Dock](/Wiki/Docks/Donations-Dock). It will remain not in the game until Roblox fixes the issue as it appears to be on their end and not mine.
* * In case you're wondering the issue is this: Donation amount #6 is indeed onsale but for one reason or another the Roblox engine will not let you buy it with the error saying it's offsale even though everywhere else (including Roblox's API which is used to list the prices on the dock) says that it's onsale.
* Added some minor functionality to the dock placing system. This wasn't really intended to be added in this update so none of the functionality is actually used in this update.
