A note before I start: At the time of writing I have been suffering from creator burnout from RBAP (the game itself) since soon after the release of V6. So for this update I just wanted to do something simple to see if I can regain my motivation for working on the game. I already had the new UI design language figured out a few months ago so it just needed to be implemented.

# Summary of its changes
{: .update-log-section-title}

{StartUpdateSummariesList}
{: .internal-use-only}

* Redesigned the game's UI design language.
* * You'll notice the new design language in the Info Dock as well as the now playing music indicators.
* The corners of scroll bars are now rounded.
* Remade the designs of the signs on the Info Dock.
* * The main difference is instead of the signs being mounted to the ground they're now being projected by a projector.

* Redesigned the game's UI design language.
* * You'll notice the new design language in the Info Dock as well as the now playing music indicators.
* * * New UI *has* been made for the intro but it just *hasn't* been implemented yet due to the intro still being in desperate need of a remake.
* * * The shop's UI has been exempt from this due to it already being pretty similar to the new design language.
* * No word yet on when any of the other UI in the game (that wasn't mentioned above) might be updated to this new design language.
* The corners of scroll bars are now rounded.
* * Hopefully all of them have been updated but I may have missed some.
* Remade the designs of the signs on the Info Dock mostly due to the UI design language change.
* * The main difference is instead of the signs being mounted to the ground they're now being projected by a projector.
* * This new design attempts to keep the theme of the previous one but also remove the transparency of the sign which results in the text being much easier to read especially when the sun is right behind the sign.
* The is version outdated statistic on the server and game info sign on the Info Dock now has a value of `Yes` instead of `True` and `No` instead of `False`.
* * This change was made to make it easier to understand.
* Moved each bullet point in the update logs sign on the Info Dock to the top instead of the middle.
* Removed a few unused backend systems.
* * They were just lingering as they haven't been used in a while.
