### This update included...

* An ALL-NEW way for **VIP server owners can now control docks!**
* Winter has left [Random Buildings And Parts](https://www.roblox.com/games/6033036061/).
* * Docks that were listed as seasonally closed have been opened up.
* * All snow has been removed.
* * The elevator has now been opened up and the possibility of spawning at the top has now been re-enabled.
* A new button on the donation section.
* The portal dock has been temporarily closed.
* The name tags have been revamped:
* * The titles are now finally up-to-date with the current ranks of the [group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/3541233/). That means you will gain appropriate titles for which rank you're in instead of gaining ones for other ranks.
* * The sizing of them now works properly
* * * So I've made it so it can now be seen throughout the whole map, it will be small but it can be seen.
* * Everything in it has been resized.
* * Everything in it now uses a new font.
* A new "[game](https://www.roblox.com/games/4787998270/)"!
* You can now press the play button (located in the intro) even while it is doing its animation.
