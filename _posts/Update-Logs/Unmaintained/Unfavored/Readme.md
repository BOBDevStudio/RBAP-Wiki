This subdirectory is for update logs that are old and very unfavored by BOB due to how they are written.

Here's exact breakdown between update logs in this subdirectory and ones update logs in the main directory:

* They're hidden from the main list of update logs.
* They're hidden from the main list of posts.
* All or most of them are hidden from the sidebar that is shown while looking at an update log.
* They have a notice on them stating that they are unmaintained.
* They're locked so comments are not allowed on them.
