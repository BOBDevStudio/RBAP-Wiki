### This update included...

* **2 ALL-NEW** Gamemodes! [spoiler]**- Currently nonexistent**[/spoiler]
* A new game pass called “Access To Beta Features".
* A new background for all of the badges.
* New thing in the main game that I am calling “The Weird Mountains”
* Some barely noticeable tweaks which includes...
* * Some helpful UI that will pop up whenever you connect or disconnect a controller.
* * The music in the game will now mute when your Roblox window is not focused.
* * The conveyor belts now actually move you now. Before it was fixed it was glitched.

### This update sadly removed...

* The mute button.
