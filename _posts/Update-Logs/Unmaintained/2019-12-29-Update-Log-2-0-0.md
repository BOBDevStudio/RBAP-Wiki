### This update included...

* An entirely new map design! <s class="spoiler">(I don't even know how to say all the changes that I've made to it.)</s>
* An entirely new UI that combines all the previous UI into one! (**I'm still working on it.**)
* 5 new docks
* A betterly organized backend
* My version of the Roblox Bloxys statue now has wings like the normal one.

### This update sadly removed...

* All previously existing UI
* The previous map
* All the badges (somewhat temporarily)
