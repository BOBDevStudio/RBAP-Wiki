# Notes about the system

* Update logs for an update before and including <code>RBAP Update / V6.0.2</code> that future changes that have a change type attached to them (instead of just a bullet point list) have their change type interpreted from the change's text.
* All updates after and including <code>RBAP Update / V5.0.0</code> use a set way of determining version numbers which is as follows (starting from the left):
* * The first number indicates a future focused update that is so impactful that It is hard to not notice a change from it (at the time of it being released). These usually contain many future focused changes.
* * The second number indicates a update that is at least partly future focused. These usually contain future focused changes but not many of them.
* * The third number indicates a pretty small update. These usually only contain bug fixes and/or minor improvements. They also have a chance of being made on the spot (like a quick maintenance update that wasn't planned ahead of time).
* Most updates before March 9th, 2019 are not logged anywhere due to the update log post on the Roblox dev forum not existing before then.
* * Some of the update logs have been recovered from older versions of Random Buildings And Parts due to there being an old update log system but that system was set up and ran differently to how the current update log system is ran.
* * * To add on to that there were periods of time where the game had no update log system in place. For example there was a time (which was roughly 2 months long) in between when the old system got removed and the update log post was made where no updates were logged.
* Update logs for updates that are older than March 9th, 2019 do not have version numbers and have no guarantees they will have the exact time the update was published.
* * This is due to the fact that they predate the update log post and were actually made for a system from around late 2018. Plus they had to be extracted from older versions of Random Buildings And Parts.
* Any update log for an update before <code>RBAP Update / V4.0.0</code> is considered not being actively maintained. When an update log is considered this it's typically purposely hard to find.
* * Reasons for this are as follows:
* * * BOB is less familiar with those updates since it's been a while since he's made them.
* * * Many of the old update logs have unnecessary hype like for example some of them may say "`ALL-NEW`". BOB has stopped using this style of update log for quite some time now.
* * * * Note that there are more differences between the styles of update logs in between the old update logs and the new update logs. Overall the newer ones are of higher quality than the older ones.
* * * Many of the changes listed in them are either changed or removed.

# Update log post tags

|-|-|
| Most Recent (Feature Focused Update)	| The *feature focused* update that is the most recently added (to the <code>Global / Main Build</code> (and must also not contain only minor changes). The update that is tagged as this is likely an update that you can at least find a few ways that it is visibly different then update that came before it. This tag is not used on an update when the update already qualifies for the `Most Recent` tag. |
| Most Recent							| The update that is the most recently added (to the <code>Global / Main Build</code>. |
| Biggest Yet							| The update is what BOB considers to be the biggest and/or most impactful one yet. It might not actually be the biggest and/or most impactful one yet as it is just based off what BOB thinks. |
| Improvements Only						| The update mainly/only improves upon stuff already in the game. |
| Bug Fixes Only						| The update mainly/only includes bug fixes. |
| RBAP Beta								| The changelog was made back when the Random Buildings And Parts was still considered to be in beta. |
