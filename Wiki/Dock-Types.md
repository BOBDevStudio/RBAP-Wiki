What is a dock type? A dock type is the status of the dock entrance that a dock is connected to. Usually it isn't something that describes the dock unless it is something like a system dock. Dock types can set many appearance settings of the dock entrance for a dock. The list includes stuff like light colors, lights that are on, the text shown on the sign, and more. Currently the text of the sign on each dock entrance is automatically made entirely uppercase.

What is a system dock? System docks are currently being classified as docks that are not a thing for showcase purposes but rather for informational purposes or something else integrated with the game itself (an example of that is the [server system dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Category/In-Game#server-and-game-info-dock)). Each system dock gets its own custom dock type which the text of the sign is automatically prefixed with `[System Dock]:`.

### Here's the list of categories of dock types:
