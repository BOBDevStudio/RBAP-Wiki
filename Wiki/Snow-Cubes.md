You may not think about it much but this little model has some history. It is (as far as BOB knows) the oldest (as of [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0)) still being used model in the game. As far as anyone knows the shape of it has not been changed in any way since it was created.

# Here's the list of all the snow cubes' appearances as of [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0):

## The Original

In a RBAP dev build version from 6:18 AM on 2/19/19 the snow cubes made its first appearance. Surprisingly the Roblox Union object behind the shape of the snow cube model has actually stood the test of time as it has not been edited since.

## [Ice Cube Tray Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Ice-Cube-Tray-Dock)

Later on the same day as the original appearance at 8:33 PM the snow cubes made its second appearance in the new [Ice Cube Tray Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Ice-Cube-Tray-Dock) (although it was not originally called a dock). This is the oldest appearance of the snow cubes that is (as of [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0)) still in the game to this day. The snow cubes that are used in the dock have remained untouched ever since they were added.

## Trees?

Somehow the snow cubes managed to find their way into being a leaf on a tree. That's right, the leaves of the trees in the middle of the map use a differently colored and sized snow cube model. This is as of [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0) the only appearance of the snow cubes that does not use the original design of the snow cubes.
