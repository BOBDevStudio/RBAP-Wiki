In Random Buildings And Parts there are multiple things that happen at different times of the year, each year. This page houses the list that will list them all.

# Here's the list of timed changes in the game currently:

The following list is listed in order by how soon it can be witnessed starting at the beginning of the year. Currently all of them use the game's time zone. Each of them can happen live in existing servers unless otherwise noted.

## An easter egg in the Game Says game on the [Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/Wiki/Docks/Game-Rooms-Dock" | relative_url -}}).

Added in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) this has a chance appear anytime during the 24th of any month. Now there is no guarantee that you'll be able to see it as it has been tested to be quite (unintentionally) rare but be looking out for it when it says to do a command. Note that the test that was conducted on it and mentioned here was done before the chance of it appearing was set to triple the normal chance.
