In Random Buildings And Parts there are multiple things that happen at different times of the year, each year. This page houses the list that will list them all (with the exception of stuff related to items in the shop).

# Here's the list of timed changes in the game currently:

The following list is listed in order by how soon it can be witnessed starting at the beginning of the year. Currently all of them use the game's time zone. Each of them can happen live in existing servers unless otherwise noted.

## 24th of any month

### An easter egg in the <code>Dock / Game Rooms Dock / Game Says</code> game on the <code>Dock / Game Rooms Dock</code>.
{: #game-says-24th-easter-egg-command-appears}

Added in <code>RBAP Update / V5.0.0</code> this easter egg in the <code>Dock / Game Rooms Dock / Game Says</code> game on the <code>Dock / Game Rooms Dock</code> has a chance appear anytime during the 24th of any month. Now there is no guarantee that you'll be able to see it as it has been tested to be quite (unintentionally) rare but be looking out for it when it says to a command. Note that the test that was conducted on it and mentioned here was done before the chance of it appearing was set to triple the normal chance.

### The <code>Dock / Old Game Rooms Dock</code> appears.
{: #old-game-rooms-dock-appears}

Added in <code>RBAP Update / V5.0.0</code> the <code>Dock / Old Game Rooms Dock</code> appears on the 24th of any month. There is a 15-minute warning time frame before the dock is removed in existing servers.

Added in <code>RBAP Update / V5.0.0</code> the map gets covered in snow and a <code>Global / Snow Cubes</code> tower appears near the start of the map. This starts December 18th and ends after the 25th. This was originally going to be added along with the winter season color palette change and stay active until the color palette changed again but due to performance concerns it was limited to about a week instead. This is often referred to as the "snow day" holiday even though it's not really a holiday and doesn't last one day.
