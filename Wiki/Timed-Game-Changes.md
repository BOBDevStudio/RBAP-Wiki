In Random Buildings And Parts there are multiple things that happen at different times of the year, each year. This page houses the list that will list them all (with the exception of stuff related to items in the shop).

# Here's the list of timed changes in the game currently:

The following list is listed in order by how soon it can be witnessed starting at the beginning of the year. Currently all of them use the game's time zone. Each of them can happen live in existing servers unless otherwise noted.

## An easter egg in the Game Says game on the [Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}).

Added in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) this has a chance appear anytime during the 24th of any month. Now there is no guarantee that you'll be able to see it as it has been tested to be quite (unintentionally) rare but be looking out for it when it says to do a command. Note that the test that was conducted on it and mentioned here was done before the chance of it appearing was set to triple the normal chance.

## The [Old Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/old-game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}) appears.

Added in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) the [Old Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/old-game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}) appears on the 24th of any month. There is a 15-minute warning time frame before the dock is removed in existing servers.

## The seasonal color palette is changed to Spring.

The seasonal color palette changes to Spring at the beginning of March.

## The seasonal color palette is changed to Summer.

The seasonal color palette changes to Summer at the beginning of June.

## The seasonal color palette is changed to Fall.

The seasonal color palette changes to Fall at the beginning of September.

## Halloween decorations get placed.

Added in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) for the month of October some Halloween decorations get placed on the map.

## The seasonal color palette is changed to Winter.

## [Christmas music]({{- "/wiki/music#christmas-appears-december-18th-26th" | relative_url -}}) becomes available and the map gets covered in snow.

Added in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) [Christmas music]({{- "/wiki/music#christmas-appears-december-18th-26th" | relative_url -}}) becomes available starting December 18th and ends after the 26th.

Also added in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) the map gets covered in snow and a [Snow Cubes]({{- "/wiki/snow-cubes" | relative_url -}}) tower appears near the start of the map. This also starts December 18th and ends after the 26th. This was originally going to be added along with the winter season color palette change and stay active until the color palette changed again but due to performance concerns it was limited to about a week instead. This is often referred to as the "snow day" holiday even though it's not really a holiday and doesn't last one day.

## [Christmas day music]({{- "/wiki/music#christmas-day-appears-december-24th-25th" | relative_url -}}) becomes available.

Added in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) [Christmas day music]({{- "/wiki/music#christmas-day-appears-december-24th-25th" | relative_url -}}) becomes available starting December 24th and ending after the 25th.
