Hidden docks are docks that are hidden by default unless they are triggered to appear by some in-game event. There are currently none in the game that use this dock entrance type as previous ones were removed in [`V3`](/Posts/Update-Log/3-0-0) of the game due to limitations of newly-implemented systems (like the dock placing system). Some of the limitations still have yet to be lifted as of [`V4`](/Posts/Update-Log/4-0-0) the most notable being the dock placing system.
