Hidden docks are docks that are hidden by default unless they are triggered to appear by some in-game event. There are currently none in the game that use this dock entrance type as previous ones were removed in <code>RBAP Update / V3.0.0</code> of the game due to limitations of (at the time) newly-implemented systems (like the dock placing system).
