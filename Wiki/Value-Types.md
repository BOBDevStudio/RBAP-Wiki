## Number

Don't think it needs to be explained, it's a number.

###### For more in-depth Roblox developer documentation on it refer to this article: [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Numbers](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Numbers)

## String

A string is a string of characters that (usually) make up one or more words. It is often listed on the wiki like this:

> `This is an example`

###### For more in-depth Roblox developer documentation on it refer to this article: [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/String](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/String)

## Table

A value that contains a list of value indexers that each correspond to a certain value. Both the value indexer and the value itself can be of all or most types. It is often listed on the wiki like this:

> {`Example1` = `Example`, `Example2` = `Example`, `Example3` = `Example`}

###### For more in-depth Roblox developer documentation on it refer to this article: [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Table#dictionaries](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Table#dictionaries)

## Array

A list of values. It's essentially a table without value indexers. The values can be of all or most types. It is often listed on the wiki like this:

> {`Example1`, `Example2`, `Example3`}

###### For more in-depth Roblox developer documentation on it refer to this article: [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Table#arrays](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Table#arrays)

## Boolean

A value that equals either `True` or `False`.

###### For more in-depth Roblox developer documentation on it refer to this article: [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Boolean](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Boolean)

## Color

Usually a image from the color images directory representing a certain color. This value type is exclusive to the wiki.

###### For more in-depth Roblox developer documentation on it refer to this article: [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/Color3)

## Blank

A value type that represents a value not being set to anything. On the wiki it is often listed by having a value on a table (**not the table value type**) missing/blank.

###### For more in-depth Roblox developer documentation on it refer to this article: [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Nil](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Nil)

## RBAP Version

A value of this type describes a certain version of Random Buildings And Parts. Each version can be viewed on [this post](RBAP/Go-To/RBAP-Update-Log). The update logs for each update can also be found [here on the website](/RBAP-Wiki/Categories#update-log). As should be pretty obvious this is a value type exclusive to the wiki.

**Note:** The update logs currently on the website are only of the [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Tags#v3) series of updates. Any update logs for the updates before that are not *guaranteed* to be added anytime soon.
