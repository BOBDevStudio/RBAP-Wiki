Random Buildings And Parts currently has 2 ways of transportation across the game's map. They are the [Player Conveyors](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Map-Transportation#player-conveyors) and [The Traveler](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Map-Transportation#the-traveler) and only one of them can be present in a server.

## Player Conveyors

The player conveyors are by far much older than The Traveler. They have been in the game in many different forms since at least around late 2018. Their current form Was introduced in [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) of the game and is of a futuristic looking conveyor belt featuring moving textures and is inspired by RB Battles' Season 2 hub.

## The Traveler

The Traveler is a special replacement of the Player Conveyors. It takes up the same amount of room as the Player Conveyors (if you don't include the guard rails). It was introduced in [`V3.2`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) of the game and is only available in select servers and in those select servers it replaces the Player Conveyors.
