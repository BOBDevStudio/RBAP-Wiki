**Note:** As of [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0) this dock is currently unused and cannot be seen anywhere in the game.

Under the hood this is the same dock as the no standing joke dock with one minor difference... instead of doing something to your character this one does a different surprise. Note that the surprise will never be listed on the wiki and is kept a secret due to it being a surprise.

This dock was removed along with the release of [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0) due to backend systems that the surprise of this dock relies on being removed in that update.
