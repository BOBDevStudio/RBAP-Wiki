This dock was used to display recent events from many different places. When there was an event the dock entrance would be open and the dock would have a specially-designed set on it for the event. After a little while BOB tended to not use it as much then as a result it later became pretty irrelevant so it got removed. Like the [Color Mixer Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Color-Mixer-Dock) it is very unlikely that this will ever be added back.
