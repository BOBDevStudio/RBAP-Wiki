This dock shows all sorts of information about the server and the game. It was originally made before [`V3`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/3-0-0" | relative_url -}}) of the game but for reasons unknown was not added until [`V3`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/3-0-0" | relative_url -}}). The system that runs the dock was completely recoded in [`V4`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/4-0-0" | relative_url -}}). This dock has always been considered a system dock.
