This dock shows all sorts of information about the server and the game. It was originally made before <code>RBAP Update / V3.0.0</code> of the game but for reasons unknown was not added until <code>RBAP Update / V3.0.0</code>. The system that runs the dock was completely recoded in <code>RBAP Update / V4.0.0</code>. This dock has always been considered a system dock.
