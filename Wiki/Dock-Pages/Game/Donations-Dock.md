After a lot of the screen UI in the game was removed this dock was added to replace the old donation screen UI. As a thank you for purchasing a donation an update before <code>RBAP Update / V4.0.0</code> added a little celebration animation after a player purchases any of the donation amounts available. <code>RBAP Update / V4.1.0</code> added another way to thank you for your donation which is when you purchase any of the donation amounts available you will get that donation amount's corresponding title. This dock has not always been considered a system dock.

The prices of each of the donation amounts available is meant to be able to help the user donate the exact (or close to the) amount of Robux that they want to donate.

### Here's the list of prices for each of the donation amount available currently:

| Donation Amount | Price |
|-|-|
| #1 | 5 Robux |
| #2 | 25 Robux |
| #3 | 50 Robux |
| #4 | 100 Robux |
| #5 | 250 Robux |
| #6 | 1000 Robux |
