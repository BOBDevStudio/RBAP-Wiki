After a lot of the screen UI in the game was removed this dock was added to replace the old donation screen UI. As a thank you for purchasing a donation an update before [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/4-0-0) added a little celebration animation after a player purchases any of the donation amounts available. [`V4.1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/4-1-0) added another way to thank you for your donation which is when you purchase any of the donation amounts available you will get that donation amount's corresponding title.

The prices of each of the donation amounts available is meant to be able to help the user donate the exact (or close to the) amount of Robux that they want to donate.

### Here's the list of prices for each of the donation amount available currently:

| Donation Amount | Price |
|-|-|
| #1 | 5 Robux |
| #2 | 25 Robux |
| #3 | 50 Robux |
| #4 | 100 Robux |
| #5 | 250 Robux |
| #6 | 1000 Robux |

| Value Name             | Value |
|-|-|
| Reserved Dock Entrance | [`2`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) |
| Entrances Used         | [`1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) |
| Entrances Centered On  | {[`1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number)} |
| Dock Types Used        | {[`1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) = [`Open`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Open)} or {[`1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) = [`Main Build Purchases Closed`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Main-Build-Purchases-Closed)} |
