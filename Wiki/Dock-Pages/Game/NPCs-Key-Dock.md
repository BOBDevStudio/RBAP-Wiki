This dock is used to help people figure out what the NPCs in the game represent. This dock was originally considered a system dock but that status was later removed when what defines a system dock was redefined. It was later reconsidered a system dock in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) due to BOB taking some time to think about what "system dock" should mean in the context of this dock.
