This dock is used to help people figure out what the NPCs in the game represent. This dock was originally considered a system dock but that status was later removed when what defines a system dock was redefined. It was later reconsidered a system dock in <code>RBAP Update / V5.0.0</code> due to BOB taking some time to think about what "system dock" should mean in the context of this dock.
