The Wheel of Oddities is a dock inspired (although not directly) by wheels you might see at a carnival or on the Wheel of Fortune game show. It features 16 different rewards all of which have the same chance of being selected and all of which (if possible) will expire after 30 seconds. The name for the dock was made by BOB and he surprisingly came up with it pretty quickly as he came up with the name right after he started thinking about names for it.

There are two determining factors that help in selecting a reward. They are Roblox physics and the amount of time the wheel is being spun for. There is a chance that you'll get the same reward as you did on a previous spin but these two factors put together make it very rare. Fun fact: Even if the wheel is spun for the same amount of time on the first spin multiple times in a row there is still a low chance that it will land on the same thing that it did previously.

The wheel can be spun for 12 to 20 seconds. When the wheel is being spun the arrow doesn't try to center itself meaning it just gets pushed off to the side by the rapidly accelerating wheel. After the wheel is no longer being spun the arrow will start to try to center itself (meaning the wheel gets slowed down) and the light on the tip of it gets turned on.

Once the arrow starts to try to center itself it has 30 seconds to land on something or the wheel will be hard reset. This is due to the fact that although rare the arrow can get stuck on one of the pegs in the wheel.
