## Four Corners

Four Corners is a classic game where there are four corners and only one of them will (in this case) be sunk. The four colors to choose from are red, green, purple, and blue. As of [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/4-0-0) this game only has one round due to how the dock was originally envisioned. This game was made to be a remake of the Four Corners game of the [Old Game Rooms Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Old-Game-Rooms-Dock). Fun fact: The color to be eliminated is chosen right as the central part starts to sink although it is not presented to the player that quickly.

## Four Corners: Reversed

This is basically the exact same thing as the Four Corners game but of course only one color is safe instead of three being safe. Like the (normal) Four Corners, this game was made to be a remake of the Four Corners: Reversed game of the [Old Game Rooms Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Old-Game-Rooms-Dock).

## Game Says

This game is basically the equivalent to a commonly played game called Simon Says. How this game works is the main sign will give some instruction along with who said the instruction and if the game is one who said it you should do it it says but if it isn't you should do the opposite of what it says. It purposely does not give you much time to think about the instructions before the barriers are enabled and platforms start sinking. This game used to have 10 rounds but was lowered down to 5 rounds in [`V4.1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/4-1-0) and then up to 7 in [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0). Unlike the other two games currently available this one is **not** a remake of a previous game from the old game rooms dock. Rather it is a replacement for the game from the [Old Game Rooms Dock](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Docks/Old-Game-Rooms-Dock) called Find The Right Color and (for the time being at least) the harder variant of it called Find The Right Color: Harder And Harder.
