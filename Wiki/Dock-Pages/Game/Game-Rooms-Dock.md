The Game Rooms Dock is an interactive dock that contains many games a player can play. The original ideas for this dock were originally taken from the [Old Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/old-game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}) but then later edited to fit into the game better. BOB considers this dock as good if not better than the [Old Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/old-game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}) as (in his opinion) this dock is much more polished compared to that dock. Differences between this dock and the [Old Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/old-game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}) include stuff like new animations for text and other stuff and a much more robust and unified backend. This dock hadn't really been changed much since it got enabled in [`V4`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/4-0-0" | relative_url -}}) until [`V5.2`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-2-0" | relative_url -}}) rolled around and added an entirely new game room that is pretty much nothing like the 2 other game rooms.

| Value Name               | Value |

| Reserved Dock Entrance   | `1` |
| Entrances Used           | `1` |
| Dock Entrance Types Used | `1` = [`Open`]({{- "/wiki/dock-entrance-types/open" | relative_url -}}) |

### Four Corners

Four Corners is a classic game where there are four corners and only one of them will (in this case) be sunk. The four colors to choose from are red, green, blue, and Unbitterness' favorite color. This game used to only have 1 round due to how the dock was originally envisioned but in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}) it was increased to 5. This game was made to be a remake of the Four Corners game of the [Old Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/old-game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}).

### Four Corners: Reversed

This is basically the exact same game as the Four Corners game but of course only one color is safe instead of three being safe. Like the normal Four Corners, this game was made to be a remake of the Four Corners: Reversed game of the [Old Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/old-game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}).

### Game Says

This game is basically the equivalent to a commonly played game called Simon Says. How this game works is the main sign will give some instruction along with who said the instruction and if the game is one who said it you should do what it says but if it isn't you should do the **opposite** of what it says. It purposely does not give you much time to think about the instructions before the barriers are enabled and platforms start sinking. Each instruction that is given is **heavily** randomized and the colors that are used are also pretty randomized.

This game used to have 10 rounds but was lowered down to 5 rounds in [`V4.1`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/4-1-0" | relative_url -}}) and then up to 7 in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}). Unlike the Four Corners games this one is **not** a remake of a previous game from the old game rooms dock. Rather it is a replacement for the game from the [Old Game Rooms Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/old-game-rooms-dock" | relative_url -}}) called Find The Right Color and (for the time being at least) the harder variant of it called Find The Right Color: Harder And Harder.

### Light Chaser

This game was added in [`V5`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-0-0" | relative_url -}}). How this game works is players must chase around a constantly moving light until it eventually stops. When it stops all platforms that it is not on will be lowered. The point at which it stops is randomly determined every time the light moves.

## Game Room 3

Added in [`V5.2`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-2-0" | relative_url -}}) this game room features games that load their own custom map that is specific to each game. Each game is single player compatible and has its own music that is played while players are playing the game.

Now you may be wondering where did BOB get the idea for this game room. Well the interesting thing about it is this game room is actually a merge of RBAP and BOB's longtime secret project that never got completed. See the issue with that secret project was that BOB had to build an entirely new game which to put it simply is not easy and every time he tried to finish it he eventually got bored of it. He then left and then eventually came back and decided to recode the entire backend to it which obviously never really worked out well. Plus to add onto that destined-to-fail plan the getting bored of it happened multiple times.

The games that are crossover from that abandoned project don't actually contain the same maps. The maps may still be heavily inspired by previous ones in the abandoned project. And a fun fact is the maps in the game room have the same exact X and Z dimensions as in the abandoned project.

In case you're wondering this abandoned project is the same as the one talked about in [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThisBeBOB_/status/1369425968931176448) and on the page for the [Construction Barrier Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/construction-barrier-dock" | relative_url -}}) (and on the dock itself).

### Door Master

This game along with Game Room 3 waz added in [`V5.2`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-2-0" | relative_url -}}). It features a field of 50 numbered doors to which you have 108 seconds to find the randomly selected door. Each door can be opened by standing on the center of it. This game is entirely possible to do while in single player and it is a port of a game from the abandoned project.

### Path Finder

This game along with Game Room 3 was added in [`V5.2`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-2-0" | relative_url -}}). It features a field full of many rows of invisible barriers with one barrier in each row missing. In order to win you have to find your way through each of the rows of barriers to the end platform before the time of 50 seconds runs out. This game is entirely possible to do while in single player and it is a port of a game from the abandoned project.

The map that is used by this game is also **heavily** inspired by the original map which was what the construction barrier model on the [Construction Barrier Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/construction-barrier-dock" | relative_url -}}) was made for before it ever came to RBAP. In fact both uses of the construction barrier in either of the maps is the same.

### Path Finder: Minefield

This game along with Game Room 3 was added in [`V5.2`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-2-0" | relative_url -}}). It features a field full of many hidden randomly placed mines to which you have to navigate your way through to the end platform in order to win. This game is entirely possible to do while in single player.
