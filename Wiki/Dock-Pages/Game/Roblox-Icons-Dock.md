The 3D Roblox logo replicas on this dock used to be in the game a while before [`V3`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/3-0-0" | relative_url -}}) ever came along but they got removed for reasons BOB can't remember but they have since been added back in [`V3`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/3-0-0" | relative_url -}}). Both of the 3D Roblox logo replicas are pulled directly from an old version of the game with the only thing that has been edited about them is their color got tweaked ever so slightly and they no longer emit light because Roblox's new lighting technology doesn't work well with the old lights. Both of these 3D replicas of Roblox's logos were made before both Roblox logo changes.
