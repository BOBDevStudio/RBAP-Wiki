The stage is one of the oldest docks in the game. It is not as old as the original window showcase but it is older than anything besides that still in the game. 

This dock has a history of not actually being in the game. Although nowadays BOB can barely remember the reasons for this, he assumed that the dock was removed temporarily because he probably wanted to remake it at the time (which he did eventually end up doing in [`V3`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/3-0-0" | relative_url -}}) of the game). The reason also could have been because of lag or some code of it needing to be updated when BOB didn't feel like it.

The design of the stage has changed a little bit over the years. Here's a list of those changes or at least the ones BOB can remember:

{% include page-notice type="warning" title="Note" text="The list below is not really in any order and is just based off what BOB remembers so it could very well be inaccurate to an extent." %}

| Change |
|-|
| The three rings on the wall above and around the center area were removed. |
| A theater-like sign was added to the wall above the center area. |
| A thing that was originally going to shoot out confetti (for unknown reasons) was added to the ceiling of the stage right above the end of the walkway nearest to the entrance. |
| The thing described in the last change was removed and replaced with a disco ball. |
| Music waves or whatever you want to call them were added. |
| The three rings were added back and merged with the theater-like sign when the stage got revamped. |
| The disco ball was removed. |

| Value Name               | Value |
|-|-|
| Reserved Dock Entrance   | `1` |
| Entrances Used           | `1` - This is set to 1 due to it causing technical issues if it is bigger but the stage does take up more than 1 dock entrance. |
| Dock Entrance Types Used | `1` = [`Open`]({{- "/Wiki/Dock-Entrance-Types/Open" | relative_url -}}) |
| Side Placed On           | `Middle Side 1` |
