This dock shows all sorts of information about the server and the game. It was originally made before [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) of the game but for reasons unknown was not added until [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version). The system that runs the dock was completely recoded in [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version). This dock has always been considered a system dock.
