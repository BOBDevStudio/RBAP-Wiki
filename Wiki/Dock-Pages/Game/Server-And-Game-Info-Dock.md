This dock shows all sorts of information about the server and the game. It was originally made before [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/3-0-0) of the game but for reasons unknown was not added until [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/3-0-0). The system that runs the dock was completely recoded in [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/4-0-0). This dock has always been considered a system dock.
