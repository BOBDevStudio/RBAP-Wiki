After a lot of the screen UI in the game was removed this dock was added to replace the old donation screen UI. As a thank you for purchasing a donation an update before [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) added a little celebration animation after a player purchases any of the donation amounts available. In an upcoming update players who purchase any of the donation amounts will unlock that donation amount's corresponding title as a another way to say thank you for the purchase.

The prices of each of the donation amounts available is meant to be able to help the user donate the exact (or close to the) amount of Robux that they want to donate.

### Here's the list of prices for each of the donation amount available currently:

| Donation Amount | Price |
|-|-|
| #1 | 5 Robux |
| #2 | 25 Robux |
| #3 | 50 Robux |
| #4 | 100 Robux |
| #5 | 1000 Robux |
| #6 | Offsale (and hasn't been on sale for quite some time now) |

| Value Name             | Value |
|-|-|
| Reserved Dock Entrance | [`2`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) |
| Entrances Used         | [`1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) |
| Entrances Centered On  | {[`1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number)} |
| Dock Types Used        | {[`1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) = [`Open`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Category/In-Game#open)} or {[`1`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) = [`Main Build Purchases Closed`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Dock-Types/Category/In-Game#main-build-purchases-closed)} |
| Side Placed On         | [`2`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#number) |
