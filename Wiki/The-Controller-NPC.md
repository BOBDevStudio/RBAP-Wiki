The Controller is an NPC in the game whose job it is to type out lines of code into a fake console. Each line of code that he types can actually work in Roblox's Lua implementation, provided you have the correct modules and values set. Most of lines of code are just picked randomly while some happen at certain times. Scroll down for the full list of the all.

# Here's every line of code available as of [`V5`](/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log/5-0-0):

Unless otherwise noted a line of code is picked at random and does not happen at certain times. The list is also in no particular order.

| print("Hello world!") | !dlrow olleH |  |
| local CommandRan = Commands:Run("Nuke") if not CommandRan then print("OOF!") end | OOF! |  |
| local Answer = QuestionAnswerer("How much of the game is made by BOB?") print(Answer) | A lot of it as there are only a few things in this game that are not made by BOB |  |
| local Answer = QuestionAnswerer("Why does BOB make me type out fake lines of code into this fake console?") print(Answer) | Not even he remembers why |  |
| if true == false then print("What is logic?") end | What is logic? |  |
| print("Yes") | But what if I don't want to? |  |
| local Answer = QuestionAnswerer("Who is BOB?") print(Answer) | BOB is the creator (and owner) of this game and he has also created most stuff in this game |  |

| if SSIntroE then print("Hmm...") end | Hmm... | `SSIntroE` is actually a hidden meaning. The only thing BOB discloses is it's hidden meaning has something to do with the game's intro as can be indicated with the word intro being in it. So far BOB has yet to disclose the meaning to **anyone**. |
