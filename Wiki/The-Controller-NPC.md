The Controller is an NPC in the game whose job it is to type out lines of code into a fake console. Each line of code that he types can actually work in Roblox's Lua implementation, provided you have the correct modules and values set. Most of lines of code are just picked randomly while some happen at certain times. Scroll down for the full list of the all.

The lists are in no particular order.

| local Answer = QuestionAnswerer("How much of the game is made by BOB?") print(Answer)										| A lot of it as there are only a few things in this game that are not made by BOB				| |  |
| local Answer = QuestionAnswerer("Why does BOB make me type out fake lines of code into this fake console?") print(Answer)	| Not even he remembers why																		| |  |
