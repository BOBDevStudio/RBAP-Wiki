Hidden docks are docks that are hidden by default unless they are triggered to appear by some in-game event. There are currently none in the game that use this dock type as previous ones were removed in [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) of the game due to limitations of newly-implemented systems (like the dock placing system). Some of the limitations still have yet to be lifted as of [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) the most notable being the dock placing system.
