This is the generic under maintenance dock type. This dock type is used when a dock is in need of maintenance in some way. An example of this being used is when the code running a dock stops working for whatever reason. This dock type isn't used too often anymore as it has been largely replaced by a system that can prevent docks from being loaded without having to update the game.
