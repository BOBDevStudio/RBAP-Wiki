## Donation Dock

After a lot of the UI in the game was removed this dock was added to replace the old donation screen UI. As a thank you for purchasing a donation [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) (or an update before [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version)) added a little celebration animation after a player purchases any of the donation amounts available.

## Lighthouse Dock

## Mine Dock

This dock was created just for the fun of it and partly because it was because BOB was testing out new stuff that he just found out how to use. This dock is one of the oldest in the game.

## No Standing Joke Dock

This was created sometime after BOB was thinking about road signs and then realized what the no standing sign says could be used literally in a joke.

## NPCs Key Dock

This dock is used to help people figure out what the NPCs in the game represent. This dock was originally considered a system dock but that status was later removed when what defines a system dock was redefined.

## Server And Game Info Dock

This dock shows all sorts of information about the server and the game. It was originally made before [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) of the game but for reasons unknown was not added until [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version). The system that runs the dock was completely recoded in [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version). This dock has always been considered a system dock.

## Showcase Dock

This was created when BOB wanted to make a window with sunlight coming through it like he saw in other showcases (because the lighting system back then was pretty minimalistic compared to how it is now). This **is** the oldest part of the game, the second oldest being the stage (more or less). This was created in the now no longer existent Roblox Legacy lighting technology and that is why it does not look as good as it did when it was made. It is very unlikely that this dock will ever be removed.

## Showcase Remastered Dock

This is recreation of the old window showcase. This one was made in the late beta of the newest Roblox lighting technology. BOB decided to make this dock just for the fun of it seeing as the old one doesn't look as good as it did when it was made.

## The Stage

The stage is one of the oldest docks in the game. It is not as old as the original window showcase but it is older than anything besides that still in the game. 

This dock has a long history of not actually being in the game. Although nowadays BOB can barely remember the reasons for this, he assumed that the dock was removed temporarily because he probably wanted to remake it at the time (which he did eventually end up doing in [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) of the game). The reason also could have been because of lag or some code of it needing to be updated when BOB didn't feel like it.

The design of the stage has changed a little bit over the years. Here's a list of those changes or at least the ones BOB can remember:

**Note:** The list below is not really in any order and is just based off what BOB remembers so it could very well be inaccurate to an extent.
{: .notice--warning}

| Change |
|-|
| The three rings on the wall above and around the center area were removed. |
| A theater-like sign was added to the wall above the center area. |
| A thing that was originally going to shoot out confetti (for unknown reasons) was added to the ceiling of the stage right above the end of the walkway nearest to the entrance. |
| The thing described in the last change was removed and replaced with a disco ball. |
| Music waves or whatever you want to call them were added. |
| The three rings were added back and merged with the theater-like sign when the stage got revamped. |
| The disco ball was removed. |

## Update Logs Dock

This dock houses the game's update logs. Update logs listed on the dock are retrieved from the web. Currently the dock only lists the most recent update log but that may change in the future. Currently the height of each line is set manually making it a very tedious process to do but in the future BOB hopes to have it be set automatically. This dock has always been considered a system dock.

BOB can never be sure why exactly he made this dock as he doesn't remember why and he can't think of any reason.
