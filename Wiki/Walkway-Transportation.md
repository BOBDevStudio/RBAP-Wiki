Random Buildings And Parts currently has 2 ways of transportation across the game's map. They are the [Player Conveyors](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Map-Transportation#player-conveyors) and [The Traveler](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Map-Transportation#the-traveler) and only one of them can be present in a server.

## Player Conveyors

The player conveyors are by far much older than The Traveler. They have been in the game in many different forms since at least around late 2018. Their current form was introduced in [`V3`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) of the game and is of a futuristic looking conveyor belt featuring moving textures and is inspired by RB Battles' Season 2 hub.

## The Traveler

The Traveler is a special replacement of the Player Conveyors. It takes up the same amount of room as the Player Conveyors (if you don't include the guard rails). When it stops at one of its stopping points the gate (aka the guard rails nearby) are/is lowered so players can walk onto and off of it. It was introduced in [`V4`](/RBAP-Wiki/Wiki/Value-Types#rbap-version) of the game and is only available in select servers and in those select servers it replaces the Player Conveyors. It is somewhat inspired by the entrance elevator and was made completely for a fun of making it.

There are no plans to replace the Player Conveyors with The Traveler due to it being affected by physics and having issues related to that and also due to the fact that it only stops at the start and the end of the map.

| Giving time for players to get onto and off it | 12-13 seconds |
| Closing gate 1 | 2 seconds |
| Leaving delay | 2 seconds |
| Traveling to gate 2 (farthest from the entrance elevator) | 20 seconds |
| Arriving delay | 2 seconds |
| Opening gate 2 | 2 seconds |
| Giving time for players to get onto and off it | 12-13 seconds |
| Closing gate 2 | 2 seconds |
| Leaving delay | 2 seconds |
