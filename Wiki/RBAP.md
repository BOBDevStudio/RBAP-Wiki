Random Buildings And Parts (spelled like that) or RBAP for short is a showcase game on Roblox by the BOB of the BOB Development Studio and is used by him to showcase stuff he's built. The main feature of the game is the [docks]({{- "/Wiki/Docks" | relative_url -}}) which are mostly used to showcase most of what BOB has made. The game was originally started somewhere in 2018 and has been worked on ever since then. Nowadays the (official) design language of a good majority of the game is semi-futuristic yet simple.

## Builds

RBAP has many different types of builds. Each builds has its own characteristic that defines what it's used for. The titles builds are usually prefixed with `Random Buildings And Parts:` with the exception of the main one.

### Main Build

Often titled simply as `Random Buildings And Parts` the main nuild is the only build currently that can joined by anyone at anytime and is also the one that update logs often refer to. It is the 2nd oldest build and has used 2 Roblox places over the course of its history.

### Pre-Update Build

The pre-update build is often used to publicly show off updates before they get officially released to the main build. This build is only used a handful of times throughout the year and has occasionally been used for other (temporary) purposes. Due to that most of the time it is closed so no one can join and updates featured inside of it often become outdated. When it is open to the public only people in certain group ranks are allowed to join. If you have saved data in this build it is automatically removed after 24 hours. It is the 3rd oldest build and has technically used 2 Roblox places over the course of its history.

### Imaging Build

The imaging build is the only build that is never open to anyone. It is mainly used to take images for game thumbnails, icons, and images used both on Roblox and here on the wiki. It features RBAP but in a frozen state and things like the season can be controlled. Although it may sound bad to edit the environment an image is taken in for the image the reason for it is not to fake the images but instead to help get more consistent images. It is the 4th oldest build and has only used 1 Roblox place over the course of its history.

### Dev Build

The dev build is often the only build that debug features are enabled in and is never open to the public but is occasionally open to select people. It can also contain some game breaking bugs that BOB hasn't had time to fix as bugs in that build are not always fixed immediately. It also contains the most recent changes to the game (although a lot of the time they are a bit buggy when just added). When BOB is working on the game this build often gets updated constantly throughout the hour especially when he play tests with multiple accounts or in the Roblox Client. It is the oldest build and has used 2 Roblox places over the course of its history.

## Practices

### Your Saved Data

The only data that is linked to you in [`V5.2`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/5-2-0" | relative_url -}}) of Random Buildings And Parts is: 

* Your preferences for what titles should be equipped.
* * This is only ever saved if you change the setting so if you leave or set all three title placement settings at their default value the data will be removed.
* Whether or not you're purchased a donation.
* * Currently there is no automated system to clear it out and you can't do it yourself. Refer to one of the sentences below this list for a way to clear it.

In case you're concerned about it, how a specific set of data is automatically cleared is also listed. To further add on to that list, in selected builds of the game (which **never** includes the main build) **all** saved data is only kept for a maximum of 30 days (but usually way shorter than that) before it is automatically removed by the Roblox engine.

Another global way to remove saved data about you is to getting contact with BOB (which is easy to do by like posting on BDS's group wall) and asking him to clear out your saved data. Although this isn't exactly recommended if there are other ways to clear out your saved data yourself. If you do use this option please specify which builds you want your data to be removed from or if you want your data to be removed from all of them please specify which ones you may have played in previously (if you can remember).

### Revenue

Although it may seem weird at first Random Buildings And Parts is not made for the purpose of gaining revenue. BOB makes it purely for self enjoyment but at the same time also tries to make it so it's fun for the player to play. And in case you were wondering, the [Donations Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/donations-dock" | relative_url -}}) is there for the purpose of giving donations for not only work done on the game but also BDS or any other game owned by the BDS.

### Localization Support

RBAP currently has no localization support due to the fact that BOB is the only one that works on it so it'd be way too time consuming to manage not to mention it costs money to upkeep for little to no return. Although what was just said is the true BOB is willing to add support for automatic translations if and when it *finally* gets fully released by Roblox.
