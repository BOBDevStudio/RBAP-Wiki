Random Buildings And Parts (spelled like that) or RBAP for short is a showcase game on Roblox that BOB (the creator of it) uses it to showcase stuff he's built. It was originally started somewhere in 2018 and has been worked on ever since then and has evolved into what you see today.

## Builds

RBAP has many different types of builds. Each builds has its own characteristic that defines what it's used for. The titles builds are usually prefixed with `Random Buildings And Parts:` with the exception of the main one.

### Main Build

Often titled simply as `Random Buildings And Parts` the main nuild is the only build currently that can joined by anyone at anytime and is also the one that update logs often refer to. It is the 2nd oldest build and has used 2 Roblox places over the course of its history.

### Pre-Update Build

The pre-update build is often used to publicly show off updates before they get officially released to the main build. This build is only used a handful of times throughout the year and has occasionally been used for other (temporary) purposes. Due to that most of the time it is closed so no one can join and updates featured inside of it often become outdated. When it is open to the public only people in certain group ranks are allowed to join. It is the 3rd oldest build and has technically used 2 Roblox places over the course of its history.

### Imaging Build

The imaging build is the only build that is never open to anyone. It is mainly used to take images for thumbnails, icons, and images on the wiki. It features RBAP but in a frozen state and things like the season can be controlled. Although it may feel bad to edit the environment an image is taken in for the image the reason for it is not to fake the images but instead to help get more consistent images.

### Dev Build

The dev build is often the only build that debug features are enabled in and is never open to the public but is occasionally open to select people. It can also contain some game breaking bugs that BOB hasn't had time to fix as bugs in that build are not always fixed immediately. It also contains the most recent changes to the game (although a lot of the time they are a bit buggy when just added). When BOB is working on the game this build often gets updated constantly throughout the hour especially when he play tests with multiple accounts or in the Roblox Client. Joining this build is controlled by 2 whitelists (one operated by Roblox and the other one operated by the game). It is the oldest build and has used 2 Roblox places over the course of its history.
