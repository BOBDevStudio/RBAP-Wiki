## Body packs

Body packs are mostly equivalent to packages (now called bundles) on the Roblox catalog. Body packs as the name suggests contain a varying number of body parts for your character. At their maximum they can contain a head, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, and a torso but usually contain all but a head. Unlike other item types there is no body pack marked as default. The body parts in the body packs are all sourced from Roblox packages/bundles on the Roblox catalog.

### Suggesting new ones

Want to suggest a new body pack? Great! As usual here are the rules for deciding what you would like:

* Every body part (with the exception of heads) must come from a package/bundle.
* Please **try** to have all of the body parts suggested (with the exception of heads) come from the same package/bundle.
* No Rthro. It doesn't fit the theme of the game and generally doesn't look that good so if any part is of Rthro it'll likely be denied.
* Every body part suggested must be uploaded by the [official account of Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/1/profile). Due to copyright issues no exceptions will be made for this rule.
* You can suggest a minimum of 1 body part (obviously).
* You can only suggest one of each body part at a time.
* Each body part must not look very similar to a body part in an already existing body pack although exceptions can be made in certain circumstances. If you're not sure if a body part fits this requirement feel free to suggest it anyway and BOB will look over it and judge based on what he thinks.
* When trying to provide a URL to a body part (which is recommended btw) please instead provide the URL of the package/bundle from which it comes from and just say what body part(s) you want from it. If it is a head that does not come with a package/bundle feel free to provide the direct URL to it.
* If you cannot provide the URL to an item on the Roblox catalog, providing the ID to it instead is fine (that's that (first and probably only) number in the URL).

Your suggestion fits within the guidelines? Great! That means you're ready to show it to BOB! As usual there are many ways of doing this but the highly recommended way is to post a message containing your suggestion on BDS's group wall. It is also possible that BOB may have some feedback and/or questions on or about your suggestion as well.
