# Types of items available currently

Info coming soon.

## Colors

Info coming soon.

### Suggesting new ones

Want to suggest a new color to be added to the shop? Great! As usual here are the rules on what to suggest:

* Colors must be provided in either HEX or RGB values. Anything else will be denied as it is pretty easy to transfer any color value into one of those two.
* Each color must not look very similar to a color in an already in the game although exceptions can be made in certain circumstances. If you're not sure if a color fits this requirement feel free to suggest it anyway and BOB will look over it and judge based on what he thinks.
* There is no (official) maximum to how many colors you can suggest that one time but try not to go too crazy.

Your suggestion fits within the rules? Great! That means you're ready to show it to BOB! As usual there are many ways of doing this but the highly recommended way is to post a message containing your suggestion on BDS's group wall. It is also possible that BOB may have some feedback and/or questions on or about your suggestion as well.

{% include page-notice type="info" title="Note" text="Colors that are suggested may be <b>very</b> lightly edited by BOB without any notice before he puts them into the game. Although this will likely be unnoticeable." %}

## Accessories

Accessories are equivalent to accessories on the Roblox catalog with the difference of the accessories in the shop all don't have specific textures. Accessories as the name suggests are accessories for your character which are added someplace on your character. Unlike most other item types there is no accessory marked as default (as in this case unlike body packs there really isn't a default accessory). All accessories in the shop are sourced from Roblox on the Roblox catalog with their texture then being removed before being put into the game.

### Suggesting new ones

Want to suggest a new accessory to be added to the shop? Great! As usual here are the rules on what to suggest:

* Every accessory suggested must not be made to work with Rthro specifically. Rthro doesn't fit the theme of the game and generally doesn't look that good so if a suggested accessory is made to work with Rthro specifically it'll likely be denied.
* Every accessory suggested must be uploaded by the [official account of Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/1/profile). Due to copyright issues no exceptions will be made for this rule.
* Accessory part must not look very similar to an already existing accessory although exceptions can be made in certain circumstances. If you're not sure if a accessory fits this requirement feel free to suggest it anyway and BOB will look over it and judge based on what he thinks.
* It is **recommended** that you provide a URL to all suggested accessories.
* If you cannot provide the URL to an accessory, providing the ID to it instead is fine (that's that (first and probably only) number in the URL).

Your suggestion fits within the rules? Great! That means you're ready to show it to BOB! As usual there are many ways of doing this but the highly recommended way is to post a message containing your suggestion on BDS's group wall. It is also possible that BOB may have some feedback and/or questions on or about your suggestion as well.

## Body packs

Body packs are mostly equivalent to packages (now called bundles) on the Roblox catalog. Body packs as the name suggests contain a varying number of body parts for your character. At their maximum they can contain a head, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, and a torso but usually contain all but a head. Unlike most other item types there is no body pack marked as default. The body parts in the body packs are all sourced from Roblox on the Roblox catalog. Also all body parts that have a texture (other than the equipped shirt or pants) on the Roblox catalog have their texture removed.

### Suggesting new ones

Want to suggest a new body pack to be added to the shop? Great! As usual here are the rules on what to suggest:

* Every body part (with the exception of heads) must come from a package/bundle.
* Please **try** to have all of the body parts suggested (with the exception of heads) come from the same package/bundle.
* No Rthro. It doesn't fit the theme of the game and generally doesn't look that good so if any part is of Rthro it'll likely be denied.
* Every body part suggested must be uploaded by the [official account of Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/1/profile). Due to copyright issues no exceptions will be made for this rule.
* You can suggest a minimum of 1 body part at a time (obviously).
* You can only suggest one of each body part at a time.
* Each body part must not look very similar to a body part in an already existing body pack although exceptions can be made in certain circumstances. If you're not sure if a body part fits this requirement feel free to suggest it anyway and BOB will look over it and judge based on what he thinks.
* When trying to provide a URL to a body part (which is **recommended** btw) please instead provide the URL of the package/bundle from which it comes from and just say what body part(s) you want from it. If it is a head that does not come with a package/bundle feel free to provide the direct URL to it.
* If you cannot provide the URL to an item, providing the ID to it instead is fine (that's that (first and probably only) number in the URL).

## Faces

Faces are equivalent to faces on the Roblox catalog. Faces as the name suggests is a face for your character. Faces usually only use around one color in their entire design. Like most other item types there is a face marked as default. All faces in the shop are sourced from Roblox on the Roblox catalog.

### Suggesting new ones

Want to suggest a new face to be added to the shop? Great! As usual here are the rules on what to suggest:

* Every fack suggested must not be made for Rthro specifically. Rthro doesn't fit the theme of the game and generally doesn't look that good so if a suggested face is made for Rthro specifically it'll likely be denied.
* * Faces with black outlines around facial features or being made out of only black lines are generally fine and don't fall under this rule. Faces that qualify for that previous sentence are also preferred by BOB but that by itself is not a qualifying factor.
* Every face suggested must be uploaded by the [official account of Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/1/profile). Due to copyright issues no exceptions will be made for this rule.
* Face part must not look very similar to an already existing face although exceptions can be made in certain circumstances. If you're not sure if a face fits this requirement feel free to suggest it anyway and BOB will look over it and judge based on what he thinks.
* It is **recommended** that you provide a URL to all suggested accessories.
* If you cannot provide the URL to an accessory, providing the ID to it instead is fine (that's that (first and probably only) number in the URL).

# History

Sometime in late December BOB came up with the idea for a concept of what could be a new design for both player characters and NPC alike. Unbitterness just happened to be online at the same time while BOB was making the prototype for new character design and so BOB asked her if he could bounce some ideas off her. He ultimately did and that conversation got BOB thinking about actually trying to make a shop even though he had previously failed to do se in and for the old abandoned project that has been mentioned previously on pages like the [Construction Barrier Dock]({{- "/wiki/docks/construction-barrier-dock" | relative_url -}}).

Later that day BOB started working on what would become the shop and that continued for many weeks straight. Along the way BOB had a hard time to avoid burnout from the entire project which Inevitably ended the shop's progress as previously mentioned. But he managed to avoid this for many weeks straight due to him setting an easy to achieve personal goal of one minor change a day at least. It helped to avoid getting tired of working on the myriad complexity that is making a flexible shop from scratch with no (existing) prior knowledge or references on how to do it.

Work on the shop do the ultimately slow down In mid-January in favor of making other changes for what would become [`V6`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/6-0-0" | relative_url -}}). Notably after this break started there were a few changes still being made to the shop among them were adding faces and accessories but the bulk of the shop was made before the break started. This break along with some other reasons led to the shop being released as a public beta [`V6`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/6-0-0" | relative_url -}}) due to the shop still having (among a few other issues) some rendering related bugs in it at the time.

So in conclusion, making a shop from scratch is super complex and difficult (especially one of this caliber) and BOB had a hard time not getting burnt out from working on it but it was worth it. Thanks for reading the initial history of the shop, hope you enjoyed it.

Also as an added bonus fact: [`V6`]({{- "/wiki/posts/update-log/6-0-0" | relative_url -}}) was originally named `V5.3` for much of December (and an unknown amount of time before that) as originally only the (text) chat command improvements were to be included in it with a few other very minor changes. It was changed mainly due to the fact that the shop was being added to it (along with some probably unintentional influence from Unbitterness).

{% include page-notice type="info" title="Pretty detailed" text="The previously listed chain of events that led up to the release of the shop are considered to be very accurate compared to other history pieces on the wiki due to the fact that it was fresh in BOB's mind at the time it was originally written." %}
